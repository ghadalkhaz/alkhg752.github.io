			cross platform storytelling
		</h1>
<p>
	For this project we were assigned to experiment with publishing online without using code on three different platforms. We had to pick a "story" and tell that story visually through our own way. Through this project I saw how  information and context can be created and varied throughout different platforms and how we could portray the same story but in alternative ways.
</p>
<p>
I chose the song "Piano Man" by Billy Joel and portrayed the story on the platforms: Pinterest, SoundCloud and TikTok.

Pinterest

	When I listen to this song I see a bunch of visuals and Billy Joel is telling a story about the people's lives who are at the bar, therefore, I thought what better way to show visuals, than images. Each part of the story is told in my mood board by different images. I wanted to make sure that there was some sort of unity in the images I chose, this is why I decided to make them all black and white, alongside that the song seems to be a memory so I thought the black and white photos could convay that idea nicely.

SoundCloud

<p>
	I had the idea to put emojis to represent the lyrics, when I first tried this I did it on a youtube video. After speaking to my professor, she suggested the idea of soundcloud and I loved the idea. So, just like my pinterest board, I put emojis to tell the story at each point of the song.

<h3>
TikTok

<p>
I wanted a fun, interactive piece for my final platform and storytimes on tiktok are extremely popular now, especially doing them with a text audio so this is what I did here.
