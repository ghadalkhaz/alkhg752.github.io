        1. X-Factor Harry 2010/2011
       </h3></font>
    <p>
      Firstly, where is all began... we have 16 year old X-Factor Harry. Adorable, fuzzy haired Harry who killed the vocals in X-Factor and was the start of an on-going, major fangirl obsession for me and many other people.

        2. Fetus Harry 2012
       </h3></font>
    <p>
      This was right after the X-Factor when One Direction just released their first album, Up All Night. He was still a baby around this time🐣(hence the name "Fetus Harry"). When I was 11 I def was obsessed with this hair style but 9 years later... not so much😬

        3. Frat Boy Harry 2013
       </h3></font>
    <p>😍😍😍 This.</p>

     <p>
       Regardless of the name of this era I would still let him hold my drink at a party. This was the Take Me Home era of One Direction and Harry looked so good and tanned and beautiful. The messy, brushed back hair was so gorgeous and I remember being so happy their stopped putting so much product on his hair😩

        4. Prince Harry 2014
       </h3></font>
    <p>PRINCE. HARRY. Any Harry Styles fan will agree that this was a high point for Harry. So magestic and just amazing. He started growing his hair out here and outgrew his "wholesome" image in favor of something a little edgier. Here we can also see that he began to be more comfortable and experiment with fashion as he started wearing clothes with paterns, necklaces, rings and so on.</p>

       <font size= +1><h3>
        5. Long Hair Harry 2015
       </h3></font>
    <p>This was the final era of One Direction😢His was when his hair was so voluptuous and shiney at this time. Here he started to resemble more of an Indie musician and also... the fashion got better😌This era of Harry wore Gucci boots, floral suits and headbands. This also seemed to be a breaking point for him, beginning to break gender stereotypes in gender, sexuality and fashion (what a king).</p>

        6. Dunkirk Harry 2016
       </h3></font>
    <p>Drum roll please for one of the <strong>MOST</strong> angelic, captivating eras of Mr. Styles. The hair... GONE. No more 1D = no more long hair, just like a breakup haircut 😔Even though all of us directioners were so sad that they "took a break" 😐 anyways... Harry gave us this short hair fantasy which we all lived for. The king started acting in his first movie role part in Dunkirk and I think I speak for all of us when I say that when we were watching for "the plot", the plot was Harry😌</p>

        7. HS1 Harry 2017
       </h3></font>
    <p>MUSIC FROM SOLO HARRY ERA!!!! The HS1 album was impaculate to say the least and so was this mans hair, fashion. and just everything tbh. This is when he <i>truly</i> started to become his own and just f**king own it. He became the rockstar that he is and always has been and just didn't give a sh*t tbh. 10/10 amazing. Oh, also, he became good friends with his icon, Stevie Nicks and sang with her at both of their concerts🙂I'm not crying, you are.

        8. Concert Harry 2018
       </h3></font>
    <p>Harry Edward Styles was touring the world at this time (something he would be doing now if we didnt have Covid🙂) and wore such iconic outfits and did photoshoots for magazines etc. He also started wearing clothes from Harris Reed which is a gender fluid fashion designer who graduated from Central Saint Martins. For Halloween he dressed up as no other than the ledgend, Elton John which was loved by many.

        9. Fine Line Harry 2019
       </h3></font>
    <p>This. Album. I have literally no words for this era. It makes me emotional (but in a cool way) just thinking about it. HOW IS THIS THE SAME PERSON FROM THE FRIST PICTURE?????😭 he's come such a long way and gained so many new fans after this album. He is himself here, so authetic and true aswell as unapologetic. A lot of boys started painted their nails, wearing jewellery, dresses and whatever they wanted because they felt empowered by Harry. I have no words for how much I love this man.</p>
    <font size= -2><p>
      also, look how happy he is❤️🖤❤️💖💓❣️💚🧡💗
