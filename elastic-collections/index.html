       My first three concepts were: Snatch Game from RuPauls Drag Race, my top 5 favorite musicians and different makeup looks.

      <p>
       When futher developing my concepts I then came up with the idea of doing American Horror Story (as it is one of my favorite shows), therefore I thought of having different images of Sarah Paulson screaming and crying on AHS. I also thought of doing the different makeup looks I have done to be more specific.

      <p>
       I was assigned to be partners with Ashley. I chose to focus on Sarah Paulson screaming and crying on AHS as it is very icon and she is well known for this (I also thought it would be fun to do).

      <p>
       Within the same document I made folders of each season of AHS where she is screaming and crying. I also made a google doc to write the 3 sub categories for Ashley's project. This can find <a href= "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BN_CvbGjf-x4aLpJaRYlsaT5xr4e6oyOWjJernPZuK0/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a>
