<h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line two cookie sheets with parchment paper or lightly spray with oil.</li>
      <li>Mix the ground flaxseed and water in a small bowl and set aside to make your flax egg.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the softened vegan butter and brown sugar for 1-2 minutes until creamy.</li>
      <li>Add the vanilla and the flax egg and mix to combine.</li>
      <li>Next, stop the mixer and add the flour. Sprinkle the cornstarch, baking soda and salt on top of the flour. Turn the mixer on low speed, and mix until just combined. </li>
      <li>Add in the chocolate chips to incorporate, either by hand or using the mixer.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough into balls, about 1-2 tablespoons each. Place on the prepared pans and bake for 10 minutes (12 minutes for larger cookies), until they are barely golden around the edges. <i><b>Do NOT over bake!</b></i> They will be puffy and lightly colored.</li>
      <li>Let cool on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. The cookies will firm up as they cool, and become the most perfect chewy cookies ever! Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
