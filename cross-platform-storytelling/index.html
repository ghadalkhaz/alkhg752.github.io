			cross platform storytelling
		</h1>
<p>
	For this project we were assigned to experiment with publishing online without using code on three different platforms. We had to pick a "story" and tell that story visually through our own way. Through this project I saw how  information and context can be created and varied throughout different platforms and how we could portray the same story but in alternative ways.
</p>
<p>
I chose the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_g7fPjVxvg">Piano Man" by Billy Joel</a> and portrayed the story on the platforms: Pinterest, SoundCloud and TikTok.

<h3>
Pinterest
</h3>
<p>
	When I listen to this song I see a bunch of visuals and Billy Joel is telling a story about the people's lives who are at the bar, therefore, I thought what better way to show visuals, than images. Each part of the story is told in my mood board by different images. I wanted to make sure that there was some sort of unity in the images I chose, this is why I decided to make them all black and white, alongside that the song seems to be a memory so I thought the black and white photos could convay that idea nicely.

<h3>
SoundCloud
</h3>
<p>
	I had the idea to put emojis to represent the lyrics, when I first tried this I did it on a youtube video. After speaking to my professor, she suggested the idea of soundcloud and I loved the idea. So, just like my pinterest board, I put emojis to tell the story at each point of the song.

<h3>
TikTok
</h3>
<p>
I wanted a fun, interactive piece for my final platform and storytimes on tiktok are extremely popular now, especially doing them with a text audio so this is what I did here.

  Lyrics
    </i></h2>
    <p><i>It's nine o'clock on a saturday</i></p>
    <p><i>Regular crowd shuffles in</i></p>
    <p><i>There's an old man sittin' next to me</i></p>
<p><i>Makin' love to his tonic and gin</i></p>
<p><i>He says: "Son can you play me a memory?"</i></p>
<p><i>I'm not really sure how it goes</i></p>
<p><i>But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete</i></p>
<p><i>When I wore a younger man's clothes</i></p>
<p><i>La-la-la de-de da</i></p>
<p><i>La-la de-de da da-da</i></p>
<p><i>Sing us a song you're the piano man</i></p>
<p><i>Sing us a song tonight</i></p>
<p><i>Well we're all in the mood for a melody</i></p>
<p><i>And you've got us feelin' alright</i></p>
<p><i>Now John at the bar is a friend of mine</i></p>
<p><i>He gets me my drinks for free</i></p>
<p><i>And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke</i></p>
<p><i>But there's someplace that he'd rather be</i></p>
<p><i>He says Bill I believe this is killing me</i></p>
<p><i>As a smile ran away from his face</i></p>
<p><i>Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star</i></p>
<p><i>If I could get out of this place</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, la-la-la de-de da</i></p>
<p><i>La-la de-de da da-da</i></p>
<p><i>Now Paul is a real estate novelist</i></p>
<p><i>Who never had time for a wife</i></p>
<p><i>And he's talkin' with Davy who's still in the navy</i></p>
<p><i>And probably will be for life</i></p>
<p><i>And the waitress is practicing politics</i></p>
<p><i>As the businessmen slowly get stoned</i></p>
<p><i>Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness</i></p>
<p><i>But it's better than drinkin' alone</i></p>
<p><i>Sing us the song you're the piano man</i></p>
<p><i>Sing us a song tonight</i></p>
<p><i>Well we're all in the mood for a melody</i></p>
<p><i>And you've got us feelin' alright</i></p>
<p><i>It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday</i></p>
<p><i>And the manager gives me a smile</i></p>
<p><i>'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see</i></p>
<p><i>To forget about life for a while</i></p>
<p><i>And the piano it sounds like a carnival</i></p>
<p><i>And the microphone smells like a beer</i></p>
<p><i>And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar</i></p>
<p><i>And say man what are you doin' here?</i></p>
<p><i>Oh, la-la-la de-de da</i></p>
<p><i>La-la de-de da da-da</i></p>
<p>S<i>ing us the song you're the piano man</i></p>
    <p><i>Sing us a song tonight</i></p>
<p><i>Well we're all in the mood for a melody</i></p>
<p><i>And you've got us feelin' alright</i></p>
