       MUSIC FROM SOLO HARRY ERA!!!!
                            <br>
       The HS1 album was impaculate to say the least
                            <br>
       and so was this mans hair, fashion. and just
                            <br>
       everything tbh. This is when he <i>truly</i> started to
                            <br>
       become his own and just f**king own it. He became
                            <br>
       the rockstar that he is and always has been and just
                            <br>
       didn't give a sh*t. 10/10 amazing. Oh, also, he became
                            <br>
       good friends with his icon, Stevie Nicks and sang
                            <br>
       with her at both of their concertsðŸ™‚
                            <br>
       I'm not crying, you are.
