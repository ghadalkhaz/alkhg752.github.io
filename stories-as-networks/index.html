		<h1> Going with the Flow </h1>

      <h2>
      I chose the text Going with the Flow by Eleanor Morgan. In this piece she speaks in depth about the changes that go on in a woman’s body. At the start of this piece, she sets a scene of her observing different women on a train and thinks to herself about how each one of these females have had their periods and their own journeys. She also speaks about how society treats this topic and how we shy away from talking about it because it makes some people (men) uncomfortable. It is important to not shy away, not avoid our symptoms, speak up; because many females have gone through the exact same symptoms. She is well spoken and unapologetic with her voice in this text. <br>
The first thing that came to mind while reading this was the show ‘Big Mouth’, since no images are allowed, I thought it would be quite fun to involve the show's lightness and sense of humour to my piece, also having Morgan’s voice throughout it but in a more joyful way. Another idea was to have the page be laid out as an Iceberg as she touches upon this “iceberg method” which I thought was interesting. Basically, while you scroll down the writing and text gets deeper in a way, just like your thoughts. My last idea was to have different shapes and when you hover over them a different color of red will appear with a story/section of her reading.

        I ending liking my third sketch the most as I wanted to push boundaries and make the viewer slightly uncomfortable with putting a pad in their face, however, I want to be quite subtle about it.

        <li><a href="https://going-with-the-flow-trial.glitch.me">I then tried putting the paragraphs into pads but I ended up not liking it as much.</a></li>

        <li><a href="https://glowing-abyssinian-budget.glitch.me">then I tried putting the whole text inside of a pad which I ended up liking but again the wings were not working.</a></li>
